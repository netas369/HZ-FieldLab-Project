# Fieldlab Zephyros – T-shore Maintenance Monitoring

## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains the work for a **university project** in collaboration with **World Class Maintenance (WCM)**, specifically focusing on the **T-shore initiative** within **Fieldlab Zephyros**.  

Fieldlab Zephyros is dedicated to developing an **unmanned digital control room** for offshore renewable energy sources such as **wind, wave, tide, and solar**.  
Our project contributes to this mission by researching and designing solutions for **predictive maintenance of offshore wind turbines**.

## 🎯 Objective  
The primary objective is to develop a **digital maintenance monitoring system** that:  
- 📊 Analyzes turbine data (real or synthetic).  
- 🔎 Detects early signals of component deterioration.  
- 🤖 Forecasts potential failures using predictive algorithms.  
- 🌬️ Provides insights into turbine efficiency factors (e.g., pitch, positioning).  
- ⚡ Helps reduce downtime and maintenance costs by optimizing repair scheduling.

## 🔬 Methodology  
We apply an **agile approach** combined with applied research methods, including:  
- Market research on control rooms  
- Expert and stakeholder interviews  
- Available product analysis & gap analysis  
- Prototyping and usability testing
